    "The purpose of this project is to formulate and backtest some basic trading algorithms using Python, in order to evaluate their performance. The `time`, `datetime`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`, `pypfopt`, `riskfolio` and `warnings` libraries are imported. Moreover, the plot styles are adjusted for aesthetic reasons and some warnings are ignored for readability (as of the time of conception, all warnings encountered in this project were warnings about deprecated features that are not used in this project)."

    "## **Moving Average Strategy**\n",
    "The moving average strategy is a trend-following strategy which aims to detect whether a trend exists in the price of financial assets over a specified time frame and take a position according to this trend. The indicator used to determine whether or not a trend exists is a pair of moving averages over specified lookback windows: one lookback window representing a shorter-term trend, and another lookback window representing the longer term trend. The trading signals of this strategy are generated as follows:\n",
    "- If the shorter-term moving average exceeds the longer-term moving average, take a long position in the financial asset(s) in question, and;\n",
    "- If the shorter-term moving average falls short of the longer-term moving average, take a short position in the financial asset(s) in question.\n",
