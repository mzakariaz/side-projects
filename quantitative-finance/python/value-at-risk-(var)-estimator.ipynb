    "The purpose of this project is to provide a method to immediately estimate, using Python, the Value-at-Risk (VaR), and related risk functions, of a portfolio of risk-bearing assets. The `time`, `datetime`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `sympy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `yfinance`, `pypfopt`, `riskfolio` and `warnings` libraries will be imported. Moreover, a random seed value is set for reprodicibility and the plot styles are modified for aesthetic reasons."

    "In most cases, the exact values of each of the above three risk functions cannot be calculated directly. There are, however, three methods that stand out in calculating each of them: \n",

    "1. Retrieve the historical price data of the underlying asset or portfolio of assets, the frequency being the time horizon of choice;\n",

    "The historical method makes no *a priori* assumption about the profit-and-loss distribution. It only retireves the quantiles of interest.\n",
