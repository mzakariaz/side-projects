        <p id = "tribute-info">This page is a tribute to the German mathematician, linguist and polymath, Hermann Grassman, who, in today's day, is best known for his work in Linear and Multilinear Algebra, where he described the notions of exterior algebras and exterior products. His ideas later served as an inspiration for the work of Elie Cartan on differential forms.
