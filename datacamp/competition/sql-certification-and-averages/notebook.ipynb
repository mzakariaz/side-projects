Three types are: **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.\n\n1. **Mean:** The sum of values divided by their count. For example, the mean of $(3,2,3,4)$ is given by: \n$$\\frac{3 + 2 + 3 + 4}{4} = 3$$\nThe mean summarizes the dataset's overall position but is sensitive to outliers.\n\n2. **Median:** The middle value in a dataset, after sorting it in ascending order. If there's an even count, it's the mean of the two middle values. For example:\n  - The median of $(3, 1, 5, 9, 7)$ is given by:\n    $$(3, 1, 5, 9, 7) \\xrightarrow{\\text{sort}} (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) \\xrightarrow{\\text{middle value}} 5$$\n  - The median of $(1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0)$ is given by:\n    $$(1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0) \\xrightarrow{\\text{sort}} (0, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5) \\xrightarrow{\\text{mean of middle values}} \\frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2$$\nThe median summarizes the dataset's central tendency without being skewed by outliers.\n\n3. **Mode:** The most frequent value(s). For example:\n  - The mode of $(3, 2, 3, 4)$ is $3$.\n  - The mode of $(1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0)$ is $1$.\n\nThe mode highlights the most common value but gives little information on the dataset's overall position.","metadata":{},"id":"4aa74127-08e0-4536-a733-3cad52bc3cc6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![SQL_Averages](SQL_Averages.jpg)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a436ea89-032a-4fea-9224-019daba31836"},{"source":"## üî§ Word Count\n192 words (calculated using https://wordcounter.net/).","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8bf2a747-844e-4175-b4de-bec439d98e1c"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
